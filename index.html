    <h1>Convienence and Efficiency</h1>
    <p>I belive learning piano should be fun without sacrificing convience. Up until recently having a personal piano instructor required spending countless time in traffic rushing to make your in-person lessons, often times missing out on precious minutes you had hopped to spend with your instructor. I bring a fun and efficient aproach to learning piano, utilizing elements of sightreading, improvising, and theory to have you playing songs you dreamed of within no time.</p>

    <h1>Tailored to You</h1>
    <p>Every student has a different learning style, with both strengths and weaknesses. I focus on helping take your natural talents and exemplifying them. Some students have an amazing sense of rythmn, some a great ear, some can connect the theory very well. With every lesson tailored specificly to you the lessons will be not only engaging but will propell you towards your goals! </p>
